enlarged thousands of times as you can

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,349
see there are millions of micron sized

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,660
pores in the ceramic cube the key

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,969
component of the electronic atomizer is

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,130
composed of a porous ceramic substrate

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,320
and a thin layer of metallic film in

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,300
this video we will explore the secrets

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,550
of ceramic coils and talk with the

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,320
scientist since more research institute

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,420
technology what are the hidden secrets

15
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:39,719
ceramics is not the only material used

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,059
in coil design glass fiber organic

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,789
cotton metallic mesh and other materials

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,890
all have been widely adopted the ceramic

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,420
material used in coils is different from

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,640
that on our dinner table it is

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,879
engineered porous micro structures with

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,160
special compositions the raw materials

23
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,500
used in film are processed minerals from

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,140
nature after special high temperatures

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,449
centering processes interconnected micro

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,360
pores are formed inside the pore size is

27
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,100
about one-fifth of a human hair these

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,960
micro pores play a vital role in

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,450
conducting and locking the e-liquid

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,579
inside the substrate during vaporization

[Music]

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,300
thanks to the surface tension and

33
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,250
capillary action the e-liquid confirm e8

34
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:31,830
through the substrate and absorb on the

35
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:34,410
surface the porous ceramic is both

36
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,630
strong absorb ability and biological

37
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,580
compatibility similar as activated

38
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,640
carbons which are widely used in many

39
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:45,030
household appliances such as water

masks and toothpaste etc the advanced

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,270
ceramic atomizers are designed based on

43
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,280
rigorous Sciences and assembled in

44
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,170
medical grade environment they are the

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,710
next generation products for safer

46
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,570
atomization applications the heating and

47
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,100
vaporization temperature of the coils

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,929
has a direct impact on the vaping

49
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,700
experience the field coils are composed

50
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,730
of a ceramic substrate and a layer of

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,500
metallic film the ceramic is centered at

52
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,630
a high temperature and formed into the

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,549
shape of a bowl the metallic film is

54
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,160
printed onto the substrate surface with

55
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:25,230
a s shape in order to provide efficient

56
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,560
and even heating just like stove and pod

57
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,840
and cooking the atomizer vaporizes the

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,910
e-liquid into vapor while heated by the

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,910
metallic film with precise temperature

60
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:39,780
compared to other materials such as

61
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,280
fiber and cotton the film coil is

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,769
special in its physical structure

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,620
material property and industrial design

64
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,450
these combinations contribute to faster

65
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,690
rise in temperature and even temperature

66
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,519
distribution on the substrate surface

67
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,200
the precise temperature control enabled

68
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,870
by the film can greatly reduce the

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
amount of aldehydes and ketones produced

70
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,590
during the vaporization

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,590
[Music]

72
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,500
another advantage of film is the even

73
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,629
heating can effectively eliminate most

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,750
of the partial carbonation and reduce

75
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,760
the burnt taste problem ceramic

76
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,530
atomizers with proper design can not

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,019
only deliver a better vaping experience

78
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,939
for end users but also be applied in

79
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,220
other fields accurate atomization

80
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,470
enables the effective ingredients in the

81
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,790
liquid to be reproduced in the vapor and

82
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,790
assimilated more effectively

83
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,890
atomization technology has been used in

84
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,870
medical applications for long such as

85
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,240
orally inhaled drugs for treatment of

86
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,400
seasonal asthma the size of particles

87
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,610
produced in regular atomization can vary

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,680
greatly particles smaller than 2.5 um

89
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,690
can be readily deposited in the human

90
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,340
respiratory tract in oral cavity and

91
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,500
those smaller than one um can be

92
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,690
absorbed by the lung the aerosol

93
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,209
particles produced by film ceramic oil

94
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,069
are smaller than one um which lead to

95
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,980
better lung absorption more intense

96
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:07,690
flavors and greater satisfaction smore

97
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,640
Research Institute is partnering with

98
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,830
multiple national and global research

99
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,140
organizations to explore product

100
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,989
applications of the film technology and

101
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,239
medical and healthcare field

102
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,850
in summary electronic atomizer is not

103
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,320
the only application of ceramic oil with

104
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,360
more fundamental research and

105
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,880
development of next generation advanced

106
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,100
atomization technology more product

107
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,500
applications of ceramic atomizer may be

108
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,160
expected and soon become part of our

109
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,160
daily life

110
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,469
